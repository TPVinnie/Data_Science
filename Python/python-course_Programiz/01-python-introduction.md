Python is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is used in:

* Machine Learning
* Web Development
* Data Analysis
* Scientific Research
* Automation

Compared to other programming languages, Python has simple, easy-to-use syntax. This makes Python an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.

## Programs in the Videos

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

**Output**

```
Hello World
```

This is a `print()` function. It prints whatever object that is inside the parentheses `()`.

When we print strings like this, the `print()` removes quotations when it displays the output.
